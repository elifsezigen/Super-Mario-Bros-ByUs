# Super-Mario-Bros-ByUs
This Super Mario game was developed in Unity. I began the project using the [Zigurous YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/c/Zigurous), which helped establish the core gameplay mechanics. After completing the basics, I added custom features and enhancements to personalize and expand the game's functionality.
Project is too big for push to github, because this we put the OneDrive link here;
